Configuration management is quite challenging but also educational. It required engagement in every possible way. We had to spend a lot of time learning what it is and how it works. Once we understood the point, we needed to engage in working with it, and that’s when we encountered some ups and downs.

What went well?
Using GitHub was quite complicated at first but improved towards the end as we realized how it works and could see the point of using GitHub. What was even better was that we could see commits from the person who made changes in any file. We struggled at the beginning to get used to reading previous commits, which led us to change a lot of code, making things worse. It became a lesson for us to commit and read previous changes before writing or modifying anything, and that was very helpful.

What went less well?
The group work didn’t go as well because we were all lost throughout the project's duration, which made it hard for us to keep up. A bigger problem we encountered was when the project started to grow; the more we did, the harder it became to keep track of everything. It got messy, and we lost control of our project as we didn’t understand how complicated merging can be.

Did we solve the difficulties or was it a lesson learned?
We managed to redo the project, but it was still quite similar to the previous one, only now we understand more. It is more organized now than before; we know where to find different files and have really tried to code in a way that a third person can also understand what we have coded. To learn Python and be able to utilize it in this large project became a significant lesson for future courses, and there’s a lot we will carry with us.
