My Engineering Diary for the "Burgerorderer" Project

Project Overview

Project Name: Burger Orderer
Course: PA1489
Team Members: Masumeh, Rezvaneh, Fatema

We started by forming our development team. We agreed on how we would collaborate and communicate effectively throughout the project, deciding to use regular meetings to discuss progress and issues.

We chose to set up a virtual environment (venv) for our project to avoid conflicts with any global packages, which proved beneficial in managing our dependencies efficiently. For version control, we opted to use GitHub as our git server. Each team member created an account, ensuring everyone had access to the repository.

The project repository, named "BurgerOrderer," was created on GitHub, with a detailed description of the project’s goals and features. Under the Planning directory, we began listing the different product types (e.g., menus, burgers, sides, drinks) that our system would offer. Each team member was responsible for a specific product type, creating individual text files to document our ideas, which allowed us to contribute and build upon each other’s work effectively.

Throughout the project, I used several essential Git commands: git init to create a new local repository, git clone to clone the project repository from GitHub to my local environment, git status to check the status of changes, git add to stage changes for commit, git commit -m "message" to commit my changes with a descriptive message, and git push and git pull to send my local commits to the GitHub repository and update my local repository with changes from others.

One significant challenge we encountered was a merge conflict when integrating changes from different branches, which caused the project to stop functioning properly. This situation required us to restart from scratch, which, while frustrating, allowed us to clean up our project structure and organize files more effectively.

Given our limited programming and database experience, collaborating on the project proved challenging. We had to redo significant portions of the database and burger order functionality due to earlier merge issues. This experience underscored the importance of regularly backing up our work to avoid losing progress.

Despite the setbacks, we learned valuable lessons about collaboration and version control. Moving forward, I will focus on better organizing our project and ensuring clearer communication within the team. I will also take the time to research commands and functions before implementation to avoid confusion.

This project highlighted the importance of teamwork and the need for a structured approach to software development. Although we faced challenges, these experiences provided an excellent opportunity for growth and understanding in software engineering principles.
