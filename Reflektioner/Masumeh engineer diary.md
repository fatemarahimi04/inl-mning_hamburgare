My Engineering Diary for the "Burgerorderer" Project

Project Overview
Project Name: Burger Orderer
Course: PA1489
Team Members: Masumeh, Rezvaneh, Fatema

Objective:
The BurgerOrderer project aims to create a system for ordering burgers, integrating both a web client for customers to place orders and a kitchen client for managing those orders. This dual functionality will enhance the overall user experience, making it seamless for customers to customize and place their orders while enabling kitchen staff to manage and fulfill those orders efficiently.

Version Control:
We decided to use Git for version control to track changes and facilitate collaboration. We set up a repository on [insert Git hosting platform, e.g., GitHub] to store our code and documentation.

Development Environment:
After discussing various IDEs, we settled on [insert IDE name, e.g., Visual Studio Code] due to its rich features and ease of use.

Week 1: Team Formation and Initial Setup
During the first week, we focused on team formation and establishing our development environment. We held an initial meeting to discuss our project goals, individual responsibilities, and how we would manage our workflow.

Team Roles:

Fatema: Development of the Hamburger menu. 
Rezvaneh: Development of the sides menu.
Masumeh: Development of the Drinks Menu. Documentation and testing.
Repository Setup:
We created the Git repository, ensuring that all team members had access. The repository structure included folders for the frontend, backend, and documentation.

2. Collaboration and Configuration Management
First Commit:
We made our first commit with a basic folder structure and a README file outlining the project's goals and setup instructions.

Reflections:

Git Usage: We practiced essential Git commands such as git init, git add, and git commit -m "Initial commit". This hands-on experience helped us better understand version control.
Challenges: Some team members faced difficulties setting up their Git accounts and configuring their local environments. To address this, we organized a workshop to walk everyone through the setup process, which proved invaluable.
Learning: We realized the importance of ensuring that every team member is comfortable with the tools we're using to promote a smooth workflow.
3. Implementation and Documentation
Week 2: Database Structure and Docker Implementation
In the second week, we shifted our focus towards implementation. We discussed and designed the database schema for our menu and orders.

Database Design:
We created an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) to visualize the relationships between different entities (e.g., Burgers, Sides, Drinks, and Orders). This diagram served as a blueprint for our database setup.

Docker Setup:
To simplify deployment and ensure consistency across development environments, we created Docker files for both the BurgerOrderer application and the KitchenView client. We discussed the advantages of containerization and how it helps in isolating our application’s dependencies.

Reflections:

Challenges with Docker: Setting up Docker was initially challenging, especially for team members with no prior experience. We held several sessions to explain Docker concepts and best practices.
Collaboration: Effective communication was key during this phase. We used tools like Slack for daily updates and scheduled Zoom meetings to discuss any blockers.
Learning Experience: We gained significant insight into database design and the advantages of using Docker for modern application development.
4. Testing and Debugging
Week 3: Testing Implementation
As part of the BurgerOrderer project, my primary responsibility was to develop the drinks menu, which plays a crucial role in enhancing the overall dining experience for our customers.

To begin my work, I researched various drink options that would complement our burger offerings. I wanted to ensure that the drinks menu not only provided variety but also included popular and refreshing options that would appeal to our target audience.

I started by outlining the structure of the drinks menu in our application. This involved creating a clear layout that presented each drink option along with its description and pricing. I utilized HTML and CSS to design an appealing and user-friendly interface, ensuring that it aligns with the overall aesthetic established by my teammates.

In addition to the visual design, I focused on the functionality of the drinks menu. I integrated the necessary backend code to enable dynamic updates. This meant that as we add or remove drinks from our offerings, the changes would reflect automatically on the user interface without requiring a complete overhaul of the code.

To manage the data for the drinks menu effectively, I collaborated closely with Rezvaneh, who was working on the sides menu. We discussed how the two menus could interrelate, ensuring a cohesive experience for the user when ordering. Our collaborative efforts aimed at providing a seamless flow of options that would enhance the customer experience, allowing them to easily navigate between burger, sides, and drink selections.

Throughout the development process, I encountered challenges, particularly related to the integration of the drinks menu with the backend database. There were moments when the data retrieval process faced issues, resulting in delays in displaying the correct drink options. However, through diligent debugging and collaboration with my teammates, I was able to resolve these issues, ensuring that the menu was functional and accurate.

During this project, I also learned the importance of regular communication and version control. I actively participated in our group meetings to discuss progress and challenges, which helped in addressing potential conflicts before they escalated. Utilizing Git for version control allowed me to manage my changes efficiently, making it easier to collaborate with my team.

Reflecting on this experience, I recognize the value of teamwork and the need to share responsibilities. Although I primarily focused on the drinks menu, I understand that success in this project relies on all of us contributing our strengths. In future projects, I plan to continue building on my collaboration skills, ensuring that we maintain a balanced contribution from all team members.

Conclusion:
The drinks menu I developed for the BurgerOrderer project is not just a list of beverages; it’s an integral part of the overall customer experience that ties into our mission of providing delicious and satisfying meals. I’m excited to see how it complements the burgers and sides, creating a holistic dining experience for our customers.
