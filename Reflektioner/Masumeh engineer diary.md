My engineering diary for the "Burgerorderer" project
project overview: 
name of the project: Burger orderer
course: PA1489
Team members: [Masumeh, Rezvaneh, Fatema]
The BurgerOrderer project aims to create a system for ordering burgers, integrating both a web client for customers to place
orders and a kitchen client for managing those orders.This dual functionality will enhance the overall user experience, making
it seamless for customers to customize and place their orders while enabling the kitchen staff to manage and fulfill those 
orders efficiently. 
Version Control: We decided to use Git for version control to track changes and facilitate collaboration. We set up a 
repository on [insert Git hosting platform, e.g., GitHub] to store our code and documentation.
Development Environment: After discussing various IDEs, we settled on [insert IDE name, e.g., Visual Studio Code] due to its 
richfeatures and ease of use.
2. Collaboration and Configuration Management
Week 1: Team Formation and Initial Setup
During the first week, we focused on team formation and establishing our development environment. We held an initial meeting 
to discuss our project goals, individual responsibilities, and how we would manage our workflow.

Team Roles: Each member was assigned specific responsibilities:

[Fatema]: Frontend development (Web client).
[Rezvaneh]: Backend development (API and database management).
[Masumeh]: Documentation and testing.
Repository Setup: We created the Git repository, ensuring that all team members had access. The repository structure included
folders for the frontend, backend, and documentation.

First Commit: We made our first commit with a basic folder structure and a README file outlining the project's goals and setup 
instructions.

Reflections
Git Usage: We practiced essential Git commands such as git init, git add, and git commit -m "Initial commit". 
This hands-on experience helped us understand version control better.
Challenges: Some team members faced difficulties setting up their Git accounts and configuring their local environments. 
To address this, we organized a workshop to walk everyone through the setup process, which proved invaluable.
Learning: We realized the importance of ensuring that every team member is comfortable with the tools we're using to promote
a smooth workflow.
3. Implementation and Documentation
Week 2: Database Structure and Docker Implementation
In the second week, we shifted our focus towards implementation. We discussed and designed the database schema for our menu 
and orders.

Database Design: We created an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) to visualize the relationships between different entities 

(e.g., Burgers, Sides, Drinks, and Orders). This diagram served as a blueprint for our database setup.

Docker Setup: To simplify deployment and ensure consistency across development environments, we created Docker files for 

both the BurgerOrderer application and the KitchenView client. We discussed the advantages of containerization and how it 

helps in isolating our application’s dependencies.

Documentation: Each team member was responsible for documenting their module’s functionality. We created a shared Google 
Drive folder for documentation, ensuring that all team members could contribute and access the latest updates.

Reflections
Challenges with Docker: Setting up Docker was initially challenging, especially for team members who had no prior experience.
We held a few sessions to explain Docker concepts and best practices.
Collaboration: Effective communication was key during this phase. We used tools like Slack for daily updates and scheduled
Zoom meetings to discuss any blockers.
Learning Experience: We gained significant insight into database design and the advantages of using Docker for modern 
application development.
4. Testing and Debugging
Week 3: Testing Implementation
As the implementation phase progressed, we began focusing on testing to ensure our application functions as expected.

Test Case Development: We started writing unit tests for our API endpoints and frontend components. Each team member 
created test cases for their respective modules, using [insert testing framework, e.g., Jest for JavaScript or Pytest for Python].

Debugging Sessions: We held debugging sessions to troubleshoot issues as they arose. This collaborative effort was crucial in
identifying and resolving bugs quickly.
