My Engineering Diary for the "Burgerorderer" Project


We began the project by setting up a virtual environment (venv) to ensure that our dependencies were isolated from the global environment. This was a crucial step to prevent conflicts and make the project more manageable in the long run.

After setting up the environment, we created the main file, app.py, and sourced a free HTML template to build the homepage. We customized the template, changing the colors of the header and footer to pink and black to align with the design theme we envisioned.

As we moved forward, we organized our project files according to what we expected to implement later. This helped us lay a solid foundation to fill in the necessary code step by step as the project progressed.

Version control was a key aspect of our workflow, and we used Git extensively to manage it. We initialized the repository with git init, cloned it to our local machines using git clone, and tracked changes with git status. Frequent git push and git pull commands kept our commits up-to-date and synced across the team.

However, we encountered a serious problem when we attempted to merge our branches. The project unexpectedly stopped functioning, and after trying to fix it, we realized the best option was to start over from scratch. Although it was a setback, this actually worked to our advantage in some ways, allowing us to remove unnecessary code and reorganize the project more efficiently. By the time we restarted, the project structure was cleaner and easier to work with.

One of the biggest challenges we faced was collaboration, especially given our limited knowledge of programming and databases. We had to redo large sections of the project, such as the database, burger ordering system, and kitchen view, due to issues during the merge process. This taught us an important lesson: always keep backups to prevent losing critical work.

On a more positive note, working with HTML was one of the highlights for us. It was relatively simple and enjoyable to customize. Unfortunately, due to the merge issues, we didnâ€™t have enough time to polish the final design as much as we would have liked.

It was responsible for writing the drink menu. I wrote it in a way that it should communicate well and clearly with the client. The menu contains which drinks we have available, their names and the price of them. but the most important thing for me was thst the customer should be able to easily find their drink and it should work well. 


Our project did not go well because there was not much cooperation. I was constantly trying to do something but it was not allowed. That's why I decided to let the stress of the group decrease and the person who wants to do everything should do it so that we don't get into trouble together. Both this and the destruction of our project and rebuilding it are the reason why i don't commit much. I had a lot of worry and anxiety for this project because i knew we had a lot of work to do, but i could'nt do anything without the coordination of the parties because it was a group work.
