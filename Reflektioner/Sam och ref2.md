1.	The idea behind this was for the customer to be able to see the item, its price and its ingredients. The customer should also be able to remove certain items if desired. The easiest option for us was to choose a simple database that we could use. Since we only have knowledgee of the Python language, that was the only option we had. We realized that functions från JavaScript might be needed but we don´t have much experience with that language. 

2.	What went well vas that we got started with creating the directories and a Dockerfile for each. We planned how our burger orderer and kitchen view should look and what color theme we would use. 

What didn´t go so well was that we constantly forgot to document what er were doing and what we were learning. We planned who would do what but things didn´t go as we had planned. We also scheduled when the different parts would be completed but the timeline didn´t follow the plan.

The difficulties couldn´t be solved individually, instead they led to a big mess which resulted in us having to redo most of the work. What we could have done differently was to not rush from the beginning and to fully understand the task as a whole, rather than just focusing on each part individually.
