Configuration management is quite challenging but also educational. It required engagement in every possible way. We had to spend a lot of time learning what it is and how it works. Once we understood the point, we needed to engage in working with it, and that’s when we encountered some ups and downs.

What went well?
Using GitHub was quite complicated at first but improved towards the end as we realized how it works and could see the point of using GitHub. What was even better was that we could see commits from the person who made changes in any file. We struggled at the beginning to get used to reading previous commits, which led us to change a lot of code, making things worse. It became a lesson for us to commit and read previous changes before writing or modifying anything, and that was very helpful.

What went less well?
The group work didn’t go as well because we were all lost throughout the project's duration, which made it hard for us to keep up. A bigger problem we encountered was when the project started to grow; the more we did, the harder it became to keep track of everything.

Did we solve the difficulties or was it a lesson learned?
We solved the problem by creating unnecessary repositories and running tests in them to see what Github actually does, and that´s where our problem arose, as it became too many repositories and branches so we got lost and lost control. the solution was to remove the unnecessary ones and start our project from the beginning, which took some time.
