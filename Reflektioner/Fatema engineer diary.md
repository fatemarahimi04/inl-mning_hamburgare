I started by setting up a virtual environment (venv) to avoid conflicts with my global environment.

I also created app.py. I found a free HTML template to visualize the homepage.

Then, I modified the header and footer (changed them to pink and black).

I began organizing my files based on my thought process to fill them in with code later, depending on what I needed.

I used some basic Git commands, such as git init, which created a new repository, git clone to clone my files and folders from GitHub to VSCode, and git status, which shows changes that have been made but not committed. I used push and pull frequently to send my commits.

One significant conflict in our project occurred when we tried to test a merge and realized that, for some strange reason, the project completely stopped working. The idea was to merge changes from one branch to another, but it ended in disaster, resulting in a lot of extra work, like restarting the project from scratch. However, this also turned out better because I could "clean up and discard" the unnecessary parts and organize everything nicely, so I knew what was in different folders.

The difficulties we encountered were mostly related to collaboration within the group. We all had little knowledge of programming and databases, making it quite a heavy task for the three of us. Given that we had to redo most of the database, burger order, and kitchen view due to issues with merges in the previous project, this became a significant lesson for us to always keep a backup of everything so that it doesn’t just vanish into thin air.

Now, this project turned out very poorly because it doesn't show much collaboration, and it looks like I did everything myself. However, if you look at the previous project, there are commits from all three members of the group. Next time, I will make sure to organize folders, files, and code so I don’t just write a lot of random stuff, and I will also read up before trying any commands or functions.

I encountered errors that said 'no module found' even though I had the module installed. I realized that my computer or the VS Code environment itself might need to be restarted.

I had trouble opening the webpage because I got an address to go to, but I realized that it’s not possible to open both webpages with the same address. So, I changed the Flask port for the kitchen view to 5001 to get a new address.
