we began our first project on collaboration and configuration management. We chose Git as our version control system and decided to use GitHub as our server.

We formed our development team and planned how to work together effectively. Our team decided to use VSCode for coding. While itâ€™s not mandatory for everyone to use the same tool, it helps us collaborate better.

After creating our GitHub repository, we gave it a meaningful name to keep everything organized. In the "Planning" folder, we brainstormed menu items like burgers, drinks, and sides. We divided the work, and I focused on the burgers. I made my first commit by documenting my work on the side disesh. Each of us wrote in our own text files and then exchanged files to contribute to each other's sections.

We also set up a virtual environment (venv) to keep our dependencies separate and avoid conflicts later. Additionally, we started working with Docker by creating a Dockerfile for our BurgerOrderer project. I documented the steps to build and run our Docker containers, as clear documentation is crucial for team efficiency.

During our discussions, we focused on the MenuStore database and listed what information each menu item needs, such as name, ingredients, and price. We then began coding the web interface to display our menu items. Although we faced challenges setting up Flask for our application, we managed to create a basic server that listens for connections and displays the homepage correctly.

Debugging was an important part of our process as we identified and fixed various bugs, deepening our understanding of the code. We aimed to add a feature for customizable toppings on burgers. Ensuring this feature was user-friendly posed a challenge, but we successfully created an interactive experience for users.

Throughout this journey, we encountered several challenges. Learning Git felt complicated at first. We struggled with understanding previous commits, which sometimes led us to make changes that caused issues. This taught us the importance of reviewing our commits carefully. Working as a group was tough since we all had limited experience with programming and databases. As the project grew, it became harder to keep track of everything, highlighting the importance of communication and coordination among team members.

We are regularly updating our engineering diary with what we learn about configuration management. This practice helps us track our progress and reflect on our experiences.
